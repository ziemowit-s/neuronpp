        Connector object required to build new connections for Population.

        THIS OBJECT SHOULD NOT BE BUILT BY THE USER, but rather retrieved by calling
        make_connection() method of Population object.

        After setup you need to call build() method to create NEURON objects.
        build() will call population_ref._build_connector() method to create those objects inside
        Population.

            NormalTruncatedSegDist - probability of choose seg with mean and std provided. Normal
                means that choosing segments are clustered around mean with standard deviation std.
