TITLE decay of internal calcium concentration
:
: Internal calcium concentration due to calcium currents and pump.
: Differential equations.
:
: Simple model of ATPase pump with 3 kinetic constants (Destexhe 92)
:     Cai + P <-> CaP -> Cao + P  (k1,k2,k3)
: A Michaelis-Menten approximation is assumed, which reduces the complexity
: of the system to 2 parameters:
:       kt = <tot enzyme concentration> * k3  -> TIME CONSTANT OF THE PUMP
:	kd = k2/k1 (dissociation constant)    -> EQUILIBRIUM CALCIUM VALUE
: The values of these parameters are chosen assuming a high affinity of
: the pump to calcium and a low transport capacity (cfr. Blaustein,
: TINS, 11: 438, 1988, and references therein).
:
: Units checked using "modlunit" -> factor 10000 needed in ca entry
:
: VERSION OF PUMP + DECAY (decay can be viewed as simplified buffering)
:
: All variables are range variables
:
:
: This mechanism was published in:  Destexhe, A. Babloyantz, A. and
: Sejnowski, TJ.  Ionic mechanisms for intrinsic slow oscillations in
: thalamic relay neurons. Biophys. J. 65: 1538-1552, 1993)

: This file was modified by Yiota Poirazi (poirazi@LNC.usc.edu) on April 18, 2001 to account for the sharp
: Ca++ spike repolarization observed in: Golding, N. Jung H-Y., Mickus T. and Spruston N
: "Dendritic Calcium Spike Initiation and Repolarization are controlled by distinct potassium channel
: subtypes in CA1 pyramidal neurons". J. of Neuroscience 19(20) 8789-8798, 1999.
:
:  factor 10000 is replaced by 10000/18 needed in ca entry
:  taur --rate of calcium removal-- is replaced by taur*7 (7 times faster)
