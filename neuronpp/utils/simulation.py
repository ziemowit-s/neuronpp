        Create an Simulation object to control the NEURON's simulation.

        Simulation WILL NOT create a NEURON environment but rather allows to access to the
        NEURON's simulator state. So if you create many Simulation objects, all of them will have
        access to the same NEURON's state.

        After creating the Simulation object and execute the run() method for the first time
        reinit() will be called. You can also call reinit() to re-init the NEURON any time.

        :param init_v
            initial value in mV for the neuron function finitialize().
            In many cases it is -70 mV but you need to specify it explicitely.
            If left None it will take h.v_init param as default init_v.
        :param dt
            value of the fundamental integration time step, dt, used by fadvance().
            When a value is entered into the field editor it is rounded down so that an integral
            multiple of fadvance’s make up a SingleStep.

            With constant_timestep=False, the dt arg, fadvance returns at t+dt, it means that any
            variable timestep choose by the simulator is computed as next_timestep+dt.
        :param warmup
            in ms, default is 0 ms. Warmup is executed during the first call of run() method,
            before executing the first run.

            By default dt during warmup is warmup/10, so there will be 10 steps during warmup,
            however due to param constant_timestep, the number of steps and their size may vary.
            You can also define custom dt for warmup by warmup_dt param
        :param init_sleep
            sleep time in seconds. To sleep before first run.
            It performs time.sleep(init_sleep) before the first run.
        :param shape_plots:
            a list of objects returned by the function utils.utils.make_shape_plot().
            It allows to create shape plots in NEURON GUI
        :param constant_timestep
            Default is True. Decide if you want a constant timestep of the simulation.

            Multi order variable time step integration method which may be used in place of the
            default staggered fixed time step method. The performance benefits can be substantial
            (factor of more than 10) for problems in which all states vary slowly for long periods
            of time between fast spikes.

            With constant_timestep=False, the dt arg, fadvance returns at t+dt, it means that any
            variable timestep choose by the simulator is computed as next_timestep+dt.

            It perform NEURON'S call h.CVode().active(not constant_timestep)

        :param warmup_on_create:
            Default False. If True warmup will be done on Simulation object creation
        :param parallel:
            Default False. If True the computation will be run parallel. Bear in mind that the whole
            setup of the pararel computation must be done by the user.

            To get started: https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/docs/ball-and-stick-model-part-4
        :param parallel_max_step:
            Max step of parallel computation in ms. Under parallel computation no spikes can be
            delivered between machines unless this is setup.

            It sets every machine’s maximum step size to the minimum delay of netcons.
